# RSA Encryption and Decryption

This repository contains a tutorial on how to implement RSA encryption and decryption algorithms in Python.

In order to guarantee user privacy and secure data transmission, encryption methods are used.
Information that has been encrypted is changed from plain text to a secret code that can only be accessed by the intended person.
A user of RSA creates a public key using two large prime numbers and a random integer, then makes it public. This public key for cryptography is accessible to anyone.
However, the message can only be decoded by someone who is aware of the first two numbers on which the key is founded. There is no known way to circumvent this mechanism.
